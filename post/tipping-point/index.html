				<p><em>It felt great, just like the first time they cuddled, bodies close, his arms around her and peace. The same peace that kept her from leaving that first night.</em></p>

<p>He lift his head and whispered into her ear:<br />
– How would you feel about having kids?</p>

<p><em>Oh no, it&rsquo;s been two years, two wonderful if intense years together, he is wonderful, and stupid me hadn&rsquo;t told him. Oh no.</em><br />
– I am infertile – she said, as tears started running down her cheeks.<br />
– Oh.</p>

<p><em>Just oh? Oh no, oh god no.</em></p>

<p>Just as she finished that thought, he slid her arms under her and turned her to face him.</p>

<p><em>His face, oh, his beautiful face.</em></p>

<p>Gently, he put his hand on her cheeks, brushed her tears away.<br />
– How would you feel about having kids? - he repeated, finishing in a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&hellip; Yes&rdquo; - She closed her eyes as her mind drifted on how she would propose to him</p>
