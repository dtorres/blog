				<p>I like having a crush, the expectation, planning, hope and possibilities that come from this seemingly unexpected feeling.</p>

<p>I dread however, having to put myself in the other person perspective as this is a mostly one sided and proofless experience, only having met them a short while ago, I have barely any context or information on how they would react if they were to find out I like them.</p>

<p>This in turn makes me anxious and hyperaware of my actions when we are together, hindering what, it seems, people like most about me, my improvised jokes and attention to detail on random things. My most precious attributes are shut down.</p>

<p>How do I communicate my feelings to this person I&rsquo;ve just met, that maybe, happens to be a completely different person to the one I&rsquo;ve gotten to know in our handful of encounters? Or should I, in the first place?</p>

<p>The logical answer to this, is time, getting to know each other more, maybe even light flirting (I am really, really awful at it, sorry), but this feeling abhors time, knows no patience and drives me mad.<br />
I want nothing more than lay down together in a park, cuddle and talk about all those seemingly unimportant details that no one but us seems to enjoy.</p>

<p>And yet, here I am, left with a crush on you.</p>
