				<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Photoshop to process and develop the RAW pictures I take with my Canon 80D, and it does a great job at it, but it is an overkill of a tool to have considering most of my time is spent in the RAW Camera screen.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been aware of <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/">Affinity Photo</a> for a while now but I hadn&rsquo;t felt compelled to try it until the iPad version came out.<br />
A couple of weeks ago I tried and purchased <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/ipad/">Affinity Photo for iPad</a> (even though I don&rsquo;t have an iPad yet, buying one soon) and was impressed at the versatility of the tooling so I took the trial version of the Mac for a spin.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It is really (buttery even) smooth due to extensive use of Apple technologies (Open GL, GCD and Core Graphics), leaving Photoshop in shame. Previewing changes will never be the same after you&rsquo;ve tried it.</p>

<p>I was able to get results as impressive as I could with Photoshop albeit with a bit more of time spent in Affinity Photo tweaking the knobs (mainly due to the former having presets and auto features).</p>

<p>However, it does not support non-destructive processing (with an XMP sidecar) which means, if I want to come back and tweak the picture a bit more, I must apply to the RAW file the same settings I once did (ha, I already forgot them).<br />
The other option is to edit over the “revealed” picture, but I’m under the impression that at that point, all the extra bits provided by the RAW image are gone AND the afphoto format (as well as PSD) is unacceptably huge for this kind of editing when you want to long term backup a file that was roughly 15% the size.</p>

<p>I will be sticking to Photoshop on the Mac meanwhile because of that one very important feature to my use case and will continue Affinity Photo in the iPad for light and on the go editing. That way I can continue to enjoy the smoothness of it, follow its development and (hopefully) easily switch to the Mac version when they support XMP.</p>
