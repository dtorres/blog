				<p>I started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16054161-jagannath">Jagannath</a> (a compilation of stories by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4394928.Karin_Tidbeck">Karin Tidbeck</a>, the author) and before I realized, I was embraced by her narration style, submerged yet not drowning.<br />
It was easy to imagine scenery, the characters and feel moved by them.</p>

<p>So after a couple stories I started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33518530-amatka">Amatka</a><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, with no knowledge whatsoever about it, no summary, no context or prior recommendation but a quote by Ann Leckie<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> praising it.</p>

<p>The story starts with Vanja, our protagonist, a factory worker in Essre of unremarkable qualities who is tasked with travelling to Amatka and conduct a market research on hygiene products.<br />
Up to this point other than exhibiting the good narration skills of Tidbeck, it felt dull and dizzying. I couldn&rsquo;t make sense of it, had no context or legs to stand on in this book.<br />
There is no indication that it takes part in another world, things were weird, sure, but everything described in the first few chapters fit within normal &ldquo;earthy&rdquo; parameters.</p>

<p>However, all these scattered pieces start to come together later when you get some indication that this is no longer Earth, but a colonized world.<br />
Had I read the summary, I would not have felt so lost because you are told all of this.</p>

<p>From that point on, it&rsquo;s a gripping story and doesn&rsquo;t let go until you finish it. This reminded me of Breaking Bad, whose first season felt slow and dull too, I was really glad I pushed through it after being encouraged by friends.</p>

<p>Like fruit that takes time to ripen, some stories need a thorough build up before dropping you into the main course.</p>

<p>This is one of those.</p>
